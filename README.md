## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Rewire.xcodeproj in Xcode
3. Make sure all directories are added to the main app target:
   - Right-click in the Project Navigator
   - Select "Add Files to 'Rewire'..."
   - Navigate to and select any missing directories (Storage, Shared, etc.)
   - Ensure "Copy items if needed" is unchecked
   - Make sure your main app target is selected
   - Click "Add"
4. Build and run the app

## Data Storage

The app uses SwiftData for persistent storage of user data, challenges, daily logs, and more. The SwiftData implementation includes:

- A complete data model with entities for User, Challenge, DailyLog, etc.
- Relationships between entities to maintain data integrity
- A migration path from the previous file-based storage system
- A SwiftDataManager class for simplified CRUD operations

SwiftData provides several advantages:
- Swift-native API with macros for model definition
- Better performance with larger datasets
- Robust relationship management
- Support for complex queries
- Automatic schema migration

For more details on the SwiftData implementation, see the [Storage README](Rewire/Storage/README.md).
